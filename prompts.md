#### Step 1: Setup

I want to develop a web application that acts as a football coach that offers playcall suggestions and explanations for varying game situations. I want to utilize: 

- sliders/text boxes for inputs: current down, distance, yard line, time in quarter, current quarter, current score, additional info (ex. our left tackle is injured, opposing cb1 is injured, etc.), handled by either pages or realtime 
- cloud flare workers/workflows/durable objects 
- Llama 3.3 on cloud flare Workers AI to provide the play results/explanation from the user input 
- some sort of memory/state
