### Example output
#### Playcall: Trips Right, 11 Personnel, Shotgun – Counter Trey – Right
#### Reasoning:

Given the 2nd down and 1 yard to go, we need to be aggressive and try to gain a first down. The Counter Trey play is a great option as it has a high success rate in goal-line situations.

The fair weather and 50-yard line position allow us to be more aggressive with our play-calling. We can take a shot at the end zone and try to score a touchdown.

The primary read of this play is the ****Tailback**** who will be taking the handoff and running the Counter Trey. We need to make sure he reads the block of the right tackle and has a clear path to the end zone. The matchup between the tailback and the defender is in our favor, as the defender is likely to be a linebacker who is not as effective in the hole.
